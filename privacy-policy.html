    <h1>Privacy Policy for Asteroffit</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 18.08.2025</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        We do not collect personal information (such as name, email, location, or contacts) in the current version of the game.
        The game does not collect device identifiers or transmit personal data to external servers.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>In-game persistent data:</strong> We store your in-game progress data locally on your device. This includes your current <em>coin balance</em> and any other gameplay progress that must persist between sessions.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>
    <p>
        The locally stored in-game data (for example, coin balance and progress) is used solely to restore your progress when you relaunch the game and to enable gameplay features such as shooting, boss interactions, and the in-game shop.
        This information is not shared with third parties and is not used for advertising or analytics in the current version.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        This version of Asteroffit does not use any third-party services such as analytics, ads, or cloud storage. If we add third-party services in future updates, we will update this privacy policy and disclose what data is shared and with whom.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        The game is suitable for all ages.
        We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>
        Locally stored gameplay data (including coins and progress) is retained on your device until you uninstall the app, clear the app's data, or otherwise remove it through device settings.
        We do not retain or back up this persistent data to our servers in the current version.
    </p>

    <h2>6. How to Delete or Reset Your Data</h2>
    <p>
        To remove locally stored game data (including your coin balance), uninstall the app or clear the app data via your device settings. If you want us to remove any server-side data (if and when server storage is introduced in future updates), contact us at the address below.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this policy in the future. Updated versions will be published in the game description or linked in the app. The effective date at the top will indicate when the policy was last updated.
